![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/starkej2/template-tornado-fx/build/main)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

A barebones template that helps you jumpstart a new TornadoFX project. This project contains everything you need to skip the headache that's usually involved in setting up a new project and get straight to coding.

### Features
* Continuous integration provided by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
* ~Static analysis via ktlint and detekt~ (Coming Soon)
* Build files written using [Gradle's Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html)

All that's left for you to do is change the package name and get to work!
